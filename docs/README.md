GovHack is an annual open government data competition held all over Australia and New Zealand.

GovHack is about getting our best and brightest working with government data to innovate and create. It is about encouraging and celebrating our technical and creative capacity, connecting citizens with government for great outcomes, and building upon the social and economic value of open data published by government.
