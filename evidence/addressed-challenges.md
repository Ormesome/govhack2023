# The Challenges Addressed

## Challenge: Brisbane City Experience

https://hackerspace.govhack.org/challenges/brisbane_city_experience

How can you use open data and creativity to enhance the Brisbane City experience?

### Datasets

Catalog of art and heritage locations:
- https://www.data.brisbane.qld.gov.au/data/dataset/public-art
- https://www.data.brisbane.qld.gov.au/data/dataset/park-cultural-heritage-sites-anzac-locations

### Response

Street maps only show shops and locations tags by consumers and are curated by the provider (Google, Apple, Navman, etc). This purpose build "experience map" will show cultural and heritage locations. The AR experience allows layers of information and art to be applied. The VR experience allows collaborative engagement with the installations and sites.

## Challenge: Discover Heritage: Unravel Your Local Stories

https://hackerspace.govhack.org/challenges/discover_heritage_unravel_your_local_stories

Ignite a passion for heritage and bridge the gap between people and their cultural roots. How can the community discover the untold stories of their local heritage and understand its universal value. How can we create lasting impact by preserving traditions, building community bonds, and boosting local economies through heritage tourism.

### Response

Street maps only show shops and locations tags by consumers and are curated by the provider (Google, Apple, Navman, etc). This purpose build "experience map" will show cultural and heritage locations. The AR experience allows layers of information and art to be applied. The VR experience allows collaborative engagement with the installations and sites.

These sites will be enriched with a portion of the vast store of information held in the Museums of History, and users can be guided to the more complete narrative found on the site.

## Challenge: Increase Visitor Expenditure Through Smart Tourism

https://hackerspace.govhack.org/challenges/increase_visitor_expenditure_through_smart_tourism

How can we use digital technology to "upsell" to visitors to South Australia by uncovering additional attractions and experiences and/or extending their stay?

### Response

This purpose build "experience map" will show cultural and heritage locations, as well as parks and recreational facilities. The AR experience allows layers of information and art to be applied. The VR experience allows collaborative engagement with the installations and sites.

## Challenge: Highlight the diversity of South Australia's tourism product through gamification

https://hackerspace.govhack.org/challenges/highlight_the_diversity_of_south_australia_s_tourism_product_through_gamification

How can we apply gamification to engage and educate young (South) Australians about South Australia's diverse tourism product offer and through this, influence key decision makers in their household to discover more of South Australia?

### Datasets

### Response

As Pokemon Go and Foursquare demonstrated, players are willing to go out of their way to score a few points. The goal of this solution is to encourage players to go out of their way to experience culture, heritage, and recreation. Memories are strongest with an emotional attachment, easiest made with others, and so score modifiers are given for being in a group.

These memories, obtained incidentaly while playing a game, will bring players back in years to come. They will make more memories and continue the cycle even without the game.

## Challenge: Best Creative Use of Data in Response to ESG

https://hackerspace.govhack.org/challenges/best_creative_use_of_data_in_response_to_esg

How can you showcase data in a creative manner to respond to ESG challenges? How can we present and visualise data to stimulate conversation and promote change?

### Datasets

### Response

While it is anticipated that geospatial data will form the bulk of most solutions, it is hoped that the integration of AR, data enriched with historical meaning, and the social engagement will be novel.

The sort of change being driven by this solution is that of conservation, education, tourism, and national pride.
