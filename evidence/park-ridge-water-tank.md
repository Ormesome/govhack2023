The Park Ridge Water Tank Art was completed in February 2023 and was designed and painted by Paul Turnbull and local artist Laing Rahner.

Titled: 'Reflection'

This tower represents the Sothern stars and depicts an Anzac soldier and nurse, who are reflecting on their service to the country under our national Australian flag.

The Park Ridge community marked the 50th anniversary of the Park Ridge water tower, with the unveiling of a new Anzac mural, which now adorns the iconic structure along the Mount Lindesay Highway.

The location of the water tower has its own special place in their Anzac history, with Park Ridge being home to a couple of airfields during the Second World War. The airstrips ran along what is now Chambers Flat Road, cutting through to Park Ridge Road. Whilst developments are now occurring in that area, you can still see the airfields there, being quickly developed during the time in response to the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbour and the entry into the Pacific Theatre.

A stunning piece, the mural was created by artists Laing Rahner and Paul Turnbull and took 10 weeks to complete.
