# The Problem

There is a general societal disconnect that has been felt for years, and that many fear is accelerating. It's not just indigenous youth who don't know their language, or immigrants who can't name their parents home towns, dinner parties where everyone is fixated on their mobiles, or home owners who have never met their neighbours. The internet makes it increasingly easy to work from home, shop from home, and enjoy entertainment like movies and books without ever visiting a theatre or bookstore. Who will remember the significance of landmarks, or remember the stories and rich heritage we have as individuals and as a nation? Do we still remember how to make smalltalk without the use of emoji?

# The Solution

Many fear the dark digital engulfing of our youth and culture, but I say that there is a glorious light approaching, and it is not an oncoming train.

I say we go more digital!

We need to make the information available to all, in a way that is easy and intuitive to explore, educational, and most importantly social because we're building connections not just with the land but with each other.

We can start with a mobile app, not unlike google or apple maps, that indicates the location of landmarks and heritage sites.

Users can immediately begin exploring, finding places like this water tower. A simple tap, and I can read the history of this site.

Using the Augmented Reality feature of my phone I can see flyouts, callouts, and access other resources that are overlaid on the water tower.

We can gamify the process, too. I just gained a point for visiting. If I take a moment to snap a photo I gain another point, and if I tag a mate I'll gain another point. It's a pity I wasn't here with friends, because that's a multiplier.

If my mate, down in Melbourne, is into this sort of thing I can send him a message and he can join me by putting on his Virtual Reality headset.

Another friend can launch the app on her PC and we can be here together, chatting away, and examining this tower. A notification can tell me that the local government is running a water awareness campaign and has placed easter eggs here somewhere.

Speaking of easter eggs, the reverse of this water tower is empty, and a virtual art piece can be put on it that is only visible using Augmented or Virtual Reality. When it's a cultural day, a band can play here virtually and using the AR on my phone I can see the group playing, and see any digital people standing around listening.

This is a great way of becoming aware of landmarks and heritage sites and sharing that experience with friends. This is a blending of the physical world and the virtual world with the intention of raising awareness of our cultural heritage while also creating new shared experiences.

Our story, past, present, and future, is not a game.

But I still have more points than you.
